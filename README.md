# HackBio_Biocoding
This repository contains my coding tasks and projects for the HackBio internship, themed AI Ã— BIO. Over four weeks, I will explore the intersection of AI and biological data analysis. Each week's assignments, scripts, and insights will be documented here, showcasing my bioinformatics and data science progress.
# Stage Zero Task
## Task Description 
This task involved organizing my team members' information and printing it out using Python data structures without using functions, loops or conditional statements.
## Task Approach and Explanation 
A variable name called team_info was created to hold a list of five dictionaries. Each dictionary contains information about a team members including their name, Slack username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred programming language.

To access and print the details of each member individually, the syntax team_info[0] was used to retrieve the first member's information stored as a dictionary. To extract specific details, team_info[0]["Name"] was used to obtain the name. This process was repeated for each member by referencing their respective positions in the list.

using the print() statement, each team member's details were printed in a structured format. The print() statements were repeated for each member, showing their name, Slack username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred programming language. To enhance readability, the print() statement with no arguments was used to create a blank line between team member's details.
