# HackBio_Biocoding
This repository contains my coding tasks and projects for the HackBio internship, themed AI Ã— BIO. Over four weeks, I will explore the intersection of AI and biological data analysis. Each week's assignments, scripts, and insights will be documented here, showcasing my progress in bioinformatics and data science.
